# Challenge-3-password-generator

Description: Generates a random password based on what the user selects when prompted.

When the user clicks the button "Generate Password" then they are promoted for password length. If selected the number length is not in between the range of 8-128, the user is prompted to re-enter a password length within the range. The prompt will loop until the user enters a valid number.

The program then prompts the user to confirm if they would like to include special characters, lowercase letters, uppercase letters and numbers. If the user selects none of the criterias, the program will ask the user to select at least one criteria and will loop back through the prompts until one of the criterias is selected.

When all parameters have been defined, the password will appear within the password box.

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
